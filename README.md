# myresumeapp

This is my profile app. It contains my details. Some of the app features are automatic dark mode and also it supports both english and kiswahili languages
automatically

I have used kotlin and jetpack compose to create the ui and the app functionalities

I used material library for user interface since it provides a nice documentation for its features and it is good looking

The main challenge i came across was implementing my own design for the app by i was able to solve it by consulting a friend of mine who is not a UI designer but he is creative

If i have more time i would implement some animations in the app and also to add more languages and make the app to get the data from an api and also implement a mvvm architecture to avoid data loss when the app layout is recreated or the language is changed.
